                Regular toothbrushing is important for both children and adults. It helps to remove the bacteria and plaque that cause tooth decay and gum disease. It is recommended that everybody brush their teeth twice a day – in the morning and before going to bed at night.

            <p>
                Brushing your teeth is an essential part of your daily oral care, and selecting the right toothbrush is the first step in optimizing that routine. But the best toothbrush for the job depends on a variety of things that are unique to you. People struggle when surrounded by so many choices for this reason, especially when your dental professional isn't next to you to help you choose wisely.

            <h5 class="p-subtitle">types of toothbrush</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Brush 1</li>
                <li>Brush 2</li>
                <li>Brush 3</li>

                <li>Brush 5</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you replace your toothbrush every few months, you'll end up using at least four toothbrushes a year. But how do you dispose of a toothbrush? Traditional toothbrushes are made with a mixture of plastics, nylon, and rubber, which can spend years breaking down in landfills. If you're concerned about your impact on the environment, check if your local grocery store, recycling facility or local drop-off service will accept your used oral care products.

                Dentists recommend using a pea-sized amount of toothpaste for adults and kids ages 3 and up. For younger children, a rice-sized smear of toothpaste should be used from when the first tooth erupts until age 3 years.

                The CDC stresses brushing with too much toothpaste can damage enamel, because children could swallow too much fluoride while their teeth are developing. This can lead to dental flourosis, the white marking and discolorization of teeth.

                Brushing your teeth in the morning gets rid of that morning breath by removing the acid and bacteria that build up overnight. If you don't brush your teeth thoroughly and often, a substance known as tartar will accumulate on the surface of your teeth and can be difficult to clean.

                Brushing your tongue can prevent potential problems of the oral cavity such as tooth decay and periodontal disease. Improves your breath: The presence of bacteria on the tongue can lead to halitosis or bad breath. Brushing your tongue on a regular basis can remove such harmful bacteria.
